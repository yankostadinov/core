- #### What technologies does Glue42 Core support?	

**Glue42 Core** exposes [JavaScript APIs](../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html), but also offers light-weight [React](../core-concepts/glue42-client/react/index.html) and [Angular](../core-concepts/glue42-client/angular/index.html) wrappers that allow developers to use **Glue42 Core** features idiomatically in the context of their preferred web framework. 	

- #### How do I use Glue42 Core in my project?	

A **Glue42 Core** project consists of one or more [**Glue42 Client**](../core-concepts/glue42-client/overview/index.html) applications connected to the [**Glue42 Environment**](../core-concepts/environment/overview/index.html). To use **Glue42 Core** in your projects, you have to learn how to [set up the Glue42 Environment](../core-concepts/environment/setup/index.html) and [initialize a Glue42 Client](../core-concepts/glue42-client/overview/index.html#initializing_a_glue42_client). See also the [Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start/index.html) section for a quick and easy project setup.	

- #### What is a Glue42 Environment?	

The [**Glue42 Environment**](../core-concepts/environment/overview/index.html) is a set of JavaScript and JSON files that provide **Glue42 Core** functionalities to all web applications connected to the **Glue42 Environment**.	

- #### What is a Glue42 Client?	

A [**Glue42 Client**](../core-concepts/glue42-client/overview/index.html) is every web application that initializes the [**Glue42 Web**](../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library and connects to the [**Glue42 Environment**](../core-concepts/environment/overview/index.html).	

- #### What is the Glue42 CLI?	

The [**Glue42 CLI**](../core-concepts/cli/index.html) is a tool that greatly facilitates setting up and serving a **Glue42 Core** project during development and also bundling the necessary **Glue42 Core** files ready for deployment.	

- #### None of the built-in solutions work for me. How do I configure Glue42 Core to fit my project?	

Go to the [Manual](../core-concepts/environment/setup/index.html#manual) section to see how to completely control and customize the [**Glue42 Environment**](../core-concepts/environment/overview/index.html).	

- #### Where can I see a Glue42 Core demo project?	

See a full-blown demo **Glue42 Core** project [here](https://start-of-day.glue42.com/), or see and experiment with the example mini apps demonstrating **Glue42 Core** functionalities in the [Shared Contexts](../capabilities/shared-contexts/index.html), [Interop](../capabilities/interop/index.html) and [Window Management](capabilities/window-management/index.html) sections.	

- #### I want to quickly set up a project and test Glue42 Core in practice. How do I do that?	

Go to the [Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start/index.html) section to see how to quickly and easily set up and run a **Glue42 Core** project.	

- #### Is there a more in-depth tutorial for Glue42 Core?	

Yes, there are complete and detailed [JavaScript](../../tutorials/vanilla-js/index.html), [React](../../tutorials/react/index.html) and [Angular](../../tutorials/angular/index.html) tutorials about **Glue42 Core**.	

- #### I am a React developer. Is there any React documentation/tutorial about Glue42 Core?
