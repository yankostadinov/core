## Tutorials

Sometimes reading through pages and pages of instructions is simply not good enough to help you get a feel for a given technology. That's why we created several tutorials, which are designed to take you all the way from setting up your first Glue42 Core project to using all major functionalities in a real environment.

Currently we have two tutorials. Both of them follow roughly the same idea, but have nothing in common in terms of implementation.

## Vanilla JS

This is, as the name suggest, a pure JS tutorial. We recommend starting with it, even if you are a React dev. The idea is that removing all the libraries and frameworks allows us to get a better understanding of Glue42 Core. We are big fans of learning the basics first before increasing the complexity with additional tools.

You can find the tutorial [here](../../tutorials/vanilla-js/index.html).

## React

Apart from the main tools, which comprise Glue42 Core, we also have a library based on **Reack hooks**. This library make using Glue42 Core in a React app easy and intuitive. Our React tutorial follows the same basic idea of the Vanilla JS version, meaning that we start from the same place and end roughly at the same place. However, everything in between is completely different.
