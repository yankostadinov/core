## Overview

**Glue42 Core** uses the [**Glue42 Web**](../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library to provide you with the tools you need to further enhance your traditional web apps and PWAs. Achieving this does not require from your users to install any additional software. The Glue42 Web library offers several sets of APIs (Interop, Window Management and Shared Contexts) with which you can share data between applications and control window behavior.
