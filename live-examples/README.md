- A `lib` folder with a built of the [`Glue42 Web`](https://docs.glue42.com/reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library.
- A `scripts` folder with common functionality (e.g., DOM manipulation utils) or common logic between the applications in an example.

## Setting Up For Local Development

- Open a terminal in the `live-examples` folder and run `npm run install:all` to install the dependencies in all examples.
- When you go to any example, you can run `npm start` to host the example. It runs on `http://localhost:5000`.
- Each example directory contains a `serve.json` file, which configures the routes for the local dev server.
