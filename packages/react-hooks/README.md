## Overview

The [**Glue42 React Hooks**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/react-hooks) package is a library providing custom React hooks for the Glue42 Javascript libraries - [@glue42/web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html), if you are working on a **Glue42 Core** project, or [@glue42/desktop](../../../../reference/glue/latest/glue/index.html), if you are working on a **Glue42 Enterprise** project. The examples below use the [Glue42 Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library. The Glue42 React Hooks library allows you to start using Glue42 features in your React apps idiomatically in the context of the React framework.

## Prerequisites

The Glue42 React Hooks library requires the Glue42 Web, React and ReactDOM libraries installed. To install the packages, navigate to the root directory of your project and run:

```cmd
npm install --save @glue42/react-hooks @glue42/web react react-dom
```

Your `package.json` file should now have the following dependencies:

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "@glue42/web": "^1.0.0",
        "@glue42/react-hooks": "1.0.0",
        "react": "^16.13.1",
        "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
    }
}
```

*Keep in mind that the versions of the dependencies will probably be different from the example here due to newer package releases.*

## Library Features

The Glue42 React Hooks library offers a way to consume the APIs of the [Glue42 Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library in your web applications via [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). The Glue42 React Hooks library provides the following features described below.

### Context

- #### GlueProvider

The `GlueProvider` is a React context provider component. It invokes a factory function (with default or user-defined configuration) which initializes the Glue42 Web library. The `glue` object returned from the factory function is set as the context value.

Below is the signature of the `GlueProvider` component:

```typescript
GlueProviderProps {
    children: ReactNode;
    fallback?: NonNullable<ReactNode> | null;
    config?: Glue42Web.Config;
    glueFactory?: GlueWebFactoryFunction;
};

GlueProvider: FC<GlueProviderProps>;
```

- `children` - React components which may contain Glue42 related logic;
- `fallback` - *Optional*. A React component to display while initializing Glue42;
- `config` - *Optional*. A [Config](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html#!Config) object for the `GlueWeb()` factory function (for detailed configuration options, see the [Glue42 Client: Overview](../overview/index.html#initializing_a_glue42_client) section);
- `glueFactory` - *Optional*. Factory function used to initialize the Glue42 Web library. Defaults to `window.GlueWeb`.

- #### GlueContext

`GlueContext` is the React context which is used by the `GlueProvider` component. You can consume this context from anywhere inside you app with the default React hook `useContext()`.

```typescript
GlueContext: Context<Glue42Web.API>;
```

### Hooks

- #### useGlue()

The `useGlue()` hook is a React hook which will invoke the callback that you pass to it.

Below is the signature of `useGlue()`:

```typescript
<T = undefined>(
    cb: (glue: Glue42Web.API, ...dependencies: any[]) => void | T | Promise<T>,
    dependencies?: any[]
) => T;
```

- `cb` - **Required**. A sync/async callback function that will be invoked with the `glue` object and an array of user-defined `dependencies`. The callback may or may not include any Glue42-related code;
    - `glue` - the object returned from the initialization of the [Glue42Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library;
    - `dependencies` -  additional user-defined arguments for the callback;
- `dependencies` - *Optional*. An array of user-defined variables that will trigger the invocation of the provided callback based on whether the value of any of the specified variables has changed (same functionality as the [`useEffect()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects) React hook).

- #### useGlueInit()

The `useGlueInit()` hook is a React hook which initializes the [Glue42Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library. It accepts an *optional* [Config](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html#!Config) object and an *optional* Glue42 factory function as arguments.

```typescript
useGlueInitProps = (
    config: Glue42Web.Config,
    glueFactory: GlueProviderProps["glueFactory"]
) => Glue42Web.API;

useGlueInit: useGlueInitProps;
```

- `config` - *Optional*. A [Config](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html#!Config) object for the `GlueWeb()` factory function (for detailed configuration options, see the [Glue42 Client: Overview](../overview/index.html#initializing_a_glue42_client) section);
- `glueFactory` - *Optional*. Factory function used to initialize the Glue42 Web library. Defaults to `window.GlueWeb`.

## Usage

Below you can see some examples of using the Glue42 React Hooks library.

### Initialization

To access the Glue42 Web APIs, you need to initialize and (optionally) configure the [Glue42Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library (for detailed configuration options, see the [Glue42 Client: Overview](../overview/index.html#initializing_a_glue42_client) section). You can do this in two ways - by using the `GlueProvider` component or the `useGlueInit()` hook. The difference is that the `GlueProvider` initializes the Glue42 Web library and makes the returned API object (`glue`) globally available by automatically assigning it as a value to `GlueContext`, while the `useGlueInit()` hook initializes the library and returns an API object (`glue`) which you then have to make available to your other components by passing it as a prop, by creating a context or by attaching it to the global `window` object.

- #### GlueProvider

Add the `GlueProvider` component by wrapping your other components inside it (preferably the root one). `GlueProvider` will initialize the [Glue42Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library and make the Glue42 Web APIs available in your application by setting a `glue` object (returned from the initialization) as the value of `GlueContext`:

```javascript
//index.js
import "glue42/web";
import { GlueProvider } from "glue42/react-hooks";

ReactDOM.render(
    // Wrap your root component in the `GlueProvider` in order
    // to be able to access the Glue42 Web APIs from all child components.
    <GlueProvider fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>
        <App />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

- #### useGlueInit()

You can also initialize the [Glue42Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library with the `useGlueInit()` hook. Below is an example of conditional rendering of a component based on whether the Glue42 Web API is available or not. 

```javascript
import "glue42/web";
import { useGlueInit } from "@glue42/react-hooks";

const App = () => {
    // Example custom configuration for the Glue42 Web library.
    const config = {
        extends: false,
        worker: "./lib/worker.js"
    }
    const glue = useGlueInit(config);

    return glue ? <Main glue={glue} /> : <Loader />;
};

export default App;
```

Remember that when you initialize the Glue42 Web library with the `useGlueInit()` hook, you need to take care of the way you provide the `glue` object to your nested components. For example, you can use React Context or attach it to the global `window` variable.

### Consuming Glue42 Web APIs

After the [Glue42Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library has been successfully initialized, you can access the Glue42 Web APIs with the built-in React hook `useContext()` and passing `GlueContext` as its argument, or with the `useGlue()` hook.

- #### GlueContext

Below is an example of accessing the `glue` object with `GlueContext` and using the [Shared Contexts](../../../../reference/core/latest/shared%20contexts/index.html) API to get the context of the current window:

```javascript
import { useContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { GlueContext } from "@glue42/react-hooks";

const App = () => {
    const [context, setContext] = useState({});
    // Access the Glue42 Web APIs by using the `glue` object 
    // assigned as a value to `GlueContext` by the `GlueProvider` component.
    const glue = useContext(GlueContext);

    useEffect(() => {
        setContext(glue.windows.my().context);
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>My Window Context</h2>
            <pre>{JSON.stringify(context, null, 4)}</pre>
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```

- #### useGlue()

Below is an example of accessing the `glue` object with the `useGlue()` hook and using the [Window Management](../../../../reference/core/latest/windows/index.html) API to open an app in a new window on button click:

```javascript
import { useGlue } from "@glue42/react-hooks";

const App = () => {
    const openWindow = useGlue(glue => (name, url) => {
        glue.windows.open(name, url);
    });

    return (
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Client List</td>
                <td>
                    <button
                        onClick={() => {
                            openWindow("ClientList", "http://localhost:8080/client-list");
                        }}
                    >
                        Start
                    </button>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    );
};

export default App;
```

This is an example of using the [Interop](../../../../reference/core/latest/interop/index.html) API to get the window title through an already registered Interop method:  

```javascript
import { useGlue } from "@glue42/react-hooks";
import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
    const getTitle = useGlue(glue => methodName => {
        glue.interop.invoke(methodName).then(r => setTitle(r.returned._result));
    });
    return (
        <>
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            <button
                onClick={() => {
                    getTitle("T42.Demo.GetTitle");
                }}
            >
                Get Title
            </button>
        </>
    );
};

export default App;
```

### Testing

You can use your own factory function for initializing the [Glue42Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library. This is useful in Jest/Enzyme tests when you want to mock the Glue42 library: 

```javascript
//index.js
import "glue42/web";
import { mount } from "enzyme";
import { GlueProvider } from "glue42/react-hooks";

// Define a factory function which will mock the Glue42 Web library.
const glueFactory = () => {
    const glueObject = {
        interop: { invoke: jest.fn(), register: jest.fn() },
        contexts: { subscribe: jest.fn(), update: jest.fn() },
        windows: { open: jest.fn(), my: jest.fn() }
    };

    return Promise.resolve(glueObject);
};

describe("Mock Glue42", () => {
    it("Should mock the Glue42 library.", () => {
        const wrapper = mount(
        // Pass your factory function to the `GlueProvider` component.
        <GlueProvider glueFactory={glueFactory}>
            <App />
        </GlueProvider>
        );
        // Your logic here.
    });
});
```
