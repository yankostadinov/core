/**
 * @docmenuorder 1
 * @docname Glue42 Web
 * @intro
 * Glue42 Web allows JavasScript applications to integrate with other applications, part of the same Glue42 Core project via a set of APIs. With Glue42 Web you can share data with other applications, expose functionality, manage windows and notifications.
 *
 * ## Referencing
 *
 * Glue42 Web is available both as a single JavaScript file which you can include into your web applications using a `<script>` tag, and as a node.js module.
 * You can use Glue42 Web in a `script` tag include, e.g.:
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <script type="text/javascript" src="web.umd.js"></script>
 * ```
 *
 * ...or as a module:
 *
 * ``` javascript
 * import GlueWeb from `@glue42/web`;
 * ```
 *
 * When deploying your application in production, we recommend that you always reference a specific **minified** version, e.g.:
 *
 * ```html
 * <script type="text/javascript" src="web.umd.min.js"></script>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Initialization
 * When Glue42 Web is executed, it will attach a factory function to the global (window) object at runtime called **GlueWeb**. This factory function should be invoked with an optional configuration object to init the library and connect to the Glue42 Core Environment. The factory function returns a Promise that resolves with the glue API object.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```javascript
 *  GlueWeb()
 *   .then((glue) => {
 *      window.glue = glue;
 *      // access APIs from glue object
 * })
 * .catch(console.log);
 * ```

     * @intro
     * The **Application Management** API provides a way to manage Glue42 Core applications. It offers abstractions for:
     *
     * - **Application** - a program as a logical entity, registered in Glue42 Core with some metadata (name, description, icon, etc.) and with all the configuration needed to spawn one or more instances of it. The **Application Management** API provides facilities for retrieving application metadata and for detecting when an application is started.
     *
     * - **Instance** - a running copy of an application. The **Application Management** API provides facilities for starting/stopping application instances and for managing its windows.
     *
     * The **Application Management** API can be accessed through `glue.appManager`.
     *
     * See the the [AppManager](../../../../core/capabilities/application-management/index.html) documentation for more details.
